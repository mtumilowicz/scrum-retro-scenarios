# preface

# phases
1. Set the stage.
1. Gather data.
1. Generate insights.
1. Decide what to do.
1. Close the retrospective.

* for two-hour retrospective:
    * Set the stage 5% - 6 minutes
    * Gather data 30–50% - 40 minutes
    * Generate insights 20–30% - 25 minutes
    * Decide what to do 15–20% - 20 minutes
    * Close the retrospective 10% - 12 minutes
    * Shuffle time 10–15% - 17 minutes
    * Total 100% - 120 minutes
        * breaks when there is a logical stopping point, when energy drops, or when people express a need

## Set the Stage
1. start with a simple welcome and appreciation for people’s investment of time
1. restate the purpose of the retrospective and the goal for the session
1. remind people of how long you’ll meet
1. ask everyone in the room to speak
    * ask for a word or two describing a hope for the retrospective
    * when someone doesn’t speak at the beginning of the retrospective, that person has tacit permission
    to remain silent for the rest of the session
        * the point of the retrospective is to help the group think and learn together, you need every-
        one’s participation
1. outline the approach for the session
1. if your team doesn’t have working agreements, develop them now
    * most groups can address the majority of situations with five working agreements
    * example
        * working agreement "Mobile phones on silent during meetings"

## Gather Data
* gathering data creates a shared picture of what happened
    * different people have different perspectives on the same event
* start with the hard data: events, metrics, features or stories completed, and so forth
    * any event that had meaning to someone on the team
    * events example: meetings, decision points, changes in team membership, milestones, 
    celebrations, adopting new technologies
    * metrics example: burndown charts, velocity, defect counts, number of
      stories completed, amount of code refactored, effort data, and so forth
    * is only part of the data
        * feelings are at least half the story
        * feelings tell what’s important to people
        * don’t ask people how they feel
            * they may not want to talk about their feelings 
            * try asking the question a different way:
                * when were you excited to come to work? 
                * when was coming to work "just a job"? 
                * when did you dread coming to work?
                * what were the high points? 
                * what were the low points?
                * how was it to be on this iteration?
                * when were you mad/sad/surprised...?

## Generate Insights
* lead the team to examine the conditions, interactions, and patterns that contributed to their success
    * ask "why?" and begin thinking about what to do differently
* investigate breakdowns and deficiencies 
    * look for risks and unexpected events or outcomes
    * look at causes and effects, and think about them analytically

## Decide What to Do
* at this point, the team has a list of potential experiments and improvements
* now is the time to pick the top items (usually no more than one or two for an 
iteration) and plan what to do
* create story cards or backlog items
* avoid the Do-Nothing Retrospective
    * teams who identify external groups as the source of their ills and want those people to 
    change end up frustrated
    * place to start change is within the team
    
## Close the Retrospective
* close the retrospective with an appreciation for the hard work everyone
did both during the iteration and during the retrospective
* take a few minutes to perform a retrospective on the retrospective
    * look at what went well and what you could do differently in the next retrospective
