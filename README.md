# preface

# phases
1. set the stage
1. gather data
1. generate insights
1. decide what to do
1. close the retrospective

* for two-hour retrospective:
    * set the stage 5% - 6 minutes
    * gather data 30–50% - 40 minutes
    * generate insights 20–30% - 25 minutes
    * decide what to do 15–20% - 20 minutes
    * close the retrospective 10% - 12 minutes
    * shuffle time 10–15% - 17 minutes
    * total 100% - 120 minutes
        * breaks when there is a logical stopping point, when energy drops, or when people express a need

## set the stage
1. start with a simple welcome and appreciation for people’s investment of time
1. restate the purpose of the retrospective and the goal for the session
1. remind people of how long you’ll meet
1. ask everyone in the room to speak
    * ask for a word or two describing a hope for the retrospective
    * when someone doesn’t speak at the beginning of the retrospective, that person has tacit permission
    to remain silent for the rest of the session
        * the point of the retrospective is to help the group think and learn together, you need every-
        one’s participation
1. outline the approach for the session
1. if your team doesn’t have working agreements, develop them now
    * most groups can address the majority of situations with five working agreements
    * example
        * working agreement "Mobile phones on silent during meetings"

## gather data
* gathering data creates a shared picture of what happened
    * different people have different perspectives on the same event
* start with the hard data: events, metrics, features or stories completed, and so forth
    * any event that had meaning to someone on the team
    * events example: meetings, decision points, changes in team membership, milestones, 
    celebrations, adopting new technologies
    * metrics example: burndown charts, velocity, defect counts, number of
      stories completed, amount of code refactored, effort data, and so forth
    * is only part of the data
        * feelings are at least half the story
        * feelings tell what’s important to people
        * don’t ask people how they feel
            * they may not want to talk about their feelings 
            * try asking the question a different way:
                * when were you excited to come to work? 
                * when was coming to work "just a job"? 
                * when did you dread coming to work?
                * what were the high points? 
                * what were the low points?
                * how was it to be on this iteration?
                * when were you mad/sad/surprised...?

## generate insights
* lead the team to examine the conditions, interactions, and patterns that contributed to their success
    * ask "why?" and begin thinking about what to do differently
* investigate breakdowns and deficiencies 
    * look for risks and unexpected events or outcomes
    * look at causes and effects, and think about them analytically

## decide what to do
* at this point, the team has a list of potential experiments and improvements
* now is the time to pick the top items (usually no more than one or two for an 
iteration) and plan what to do
* create story cards or backlog items
* avoid the Do-Nothing Retrospective
    * teams who identify external groups as the source of their ills and want those people to 
    change end up frustrated
    * place to start change is within the team
    
## close the retrospective
* close the retrospective with an appreciation for the hard work everyone
did both during the iteration and during the retrospective
* take a few minutes to perform a retrospective on the retrospective
    * look at what went well and what you could do differently in the next retrospective

# scenarios

## activities to set the stage
* activity: **check-in**
    * purpose: help people articulate what they want from the retrospective
    * time: 5 - 10 minutes
    * description
        * each person answers with a word or short phrase
        * each person answers in round-robin fashion
    * Steps
        1. ask one question
            * what is one word that describes what you need for yourself from this session?
            * in one or two words, what is happening for you right now?
            * in a word or two, what are your hopes for the retrospective?
            * what is one thing that’s on your mind?
            * coming into this retrospective, if you were a car, what kind of car would you be?
        1. go around the room listening to each person’s answer
            * thank each person
            * refrain from offering evaluative comments such as "good" or "wonderful"
* activity: **ESVP**
    * purpose: understand people’s attitudes to the retrospective
    * time: 10-15 minutes
    * description
        * each participant reports (anonymously) his attitude toward the
        retrospective as an Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, or Prisoner (ESVP)
            * explorers are eager to discover new ideas and insights, and want to learn everything 
            they can about the iteration/release/project
            * shoppers will look over all the available information, and will
            be happy to go home with one useful new idea
            * vacationers aren’t interested in the work of the retrospective,
            but are happy to be away from the daily grind
            * prisoners feel that they’ve been forced to attend and would rather be doing  something else
        * collect the results, create a histogram and discuss what the results mean for the group
    * steps
        1. explain that you are taking a poll to learn about how people view their participation in 
        the retrospective
        1. collect data
        1. ask "what do you make of this data?"
        1. lead a brief discussion about how the attitudes in the room will affect the retrospective
    * if you plan to take a break in your retrospective, suggest that if people choose to return after 
    the break, they are choosing to attend the retrospective — they aren’t prisoners anymore

## activities to gather data
* activity: **timeline**
    * purpose
        * stimulate memories of what happened during the increment
        * create a picture of the work from many perspectives
        * see patterns or when energy levels changed
    * time: 30-90 minutes
    * description
        * group members write cards to represent memorable, personally meaningful, 
        or otherwise significant events during the iteration and then post them in 
        (roughly) chronological order
    * steps
        1. set up the activity by saying "we’ll fill in a timeline to create a
           fuller picture of this iteration/release/project; we want to see it
           from many perspectives"
        1. divide the team into small groups, with no more than five in a group
            * keep people who worked closely with each other together
        1. describe the process
        1. when all the cards are posted, invite the team to walk by the timeline and 
        see what others have posted
* activity: **like to like**
    * purpose
        * help team members recall their experiences during the iteration, and hear that 
        others may have perceived it differently
    * time: 30-40 minutes
    * description
        * team members take turns judging which events or factors about their
        iteration are the best fits for quality cards
            * cards: Fun, On Time, Clear, Meaningful, Affordable, Integrated, Educational, 
            Talented, Smooth, Cool, Speedy, Collaborative, Awesome, Trustworthy, Dangerous, 
            Frustrating, Creepy, Nasty or others
        * as the cards are evaluated, team members learn about each other’s perspective 
        on the same events or conditions
    * steps
        1. Ask each team member to write at least nine index cards for play-
        ing the Like to Like game: 
            * three or more cards with things to stop doing 
            * three or more cards with things to keep doing
            * three or more things to start doing
            * shuffle the deck of colored “quality” cards and lay the pile face down on a table
        1. when the game cards are ready, invite the team to stand around
        the table. 
            * choose one person to start as "judge" 
                * he turns over a "quality" card from the pile and puts it  face up on the table
            * all other team members look in their game cards for the one that
            most closely matches the "quality" card and place their cards face down 
            * last card down is disqualified and returns to its owner’s hand
            * this keeps the game moving
        1. "judge" stirs the players’ cards, turns them over one at a time, and reads them. 
            * he chooses the card that makes the best match with the "quality" card
                * author of that card wins the “quality” card
        1. role of "judge" passes left to the next person, and another "quality" card is turned over 
            * after six to nine rounds (or whenever everyone runs out of cards), the game ends
        1. person with the most “quality” cards wins
        1. debrief with questions
            * "what surprised you? where were you challenged?"
            * "What insight do you have about this? what does this tell you about our project?”
            * "what’s one thing you might do differently?"

## activities to generate insights
* activity: **brainstorming/filtering**
    * purpose: generate a large number of ideas and filter them against a defined set of criteria
    * time: 40-60 minutes
    * steps
        1. describe the guidelines for brainstorming.
            * challenge the group to come up with fifty ideas, and set the time limit, usually 
            10-15 minutes
        1. brainstorm using one of three methods:
            * method 1: free-for-all: people call out ideas at random
                * problem with traditional brainstorming is that it favors people who are 
                comfortable thinking aloud 
            * method 2: round-robin: pass a "talking token" around the circle 
                * only the person holding the talking token can talk 
                * it’s OK to pass when your turn comes
                * helps people who aren’t comfortable shouting out in a group participate and 
                leaves an escape (saying “pass”) to people who haven’t thought of anything... yet
            * method 3: give people 5-7 minutes to silently and individually generate 
            and write down ideas
                * when the time is up, use method 1 or 2
                * helps people who need time to gather their thoughts time to do that
        1. ask the group what filters they should apply to the ideas 
            * accept four to eight suggestions, discuss, and then vote on the top four 
        1. apply the filters one at a time to the ideas on the brainstorm lists
            * look for ideas that pass all four filters.
        1. ask for comments on the ideas 
            * ask the group which ideas they want to carry forward 
            * ask whether anyone feels strongly about taking responsibility for any of the ideas 
                * if someone feels strongly, it’s a good bet to carry forward 
                * otherwise, use the simple majority vote
* activity: **prioritize with dots**
    * purpose: to gauge how the group prioritizes a long list of candidate changes, proposals, etc.
    * time: 5-20 minutes
    * description: team members prioritize the top issues, ideas, or proposals
    * steps
        1. post a legend allocating the dots as follows:
            ```
            #1 priority receives four dots.
            #2 priority receives three dots.
            #3 priority receives two dots.
            #4 priority receives one dot.
            ```
        1. when there are clear winners, ask the group whether they want to proceed with these items
            * people can think an item is important and still not want to work on it. 
    * some variations to consider:
        * which is the most important to work on?
        * which will have the greatest impact?
        * which do you want to work on most?

## activities to decide what to do
* activity: **retrospective planning game**
    * purpose: develop detailed plans for experiments or proposals
    * time: 40-75 minutes
    * description
        * team members work individually or in pairs to brainstorm all the tasks
        necessary to complete an improvement
    * steps
        1. introduce the activity by saying, "we’re going to work on generating all the 
        tasks needed to have our improvement succeed"
        1. recap the improvement
        1. order the cards
            * start by asking: "which task must be done first?"
        1. ask, "are there any tasks that can be done simultaneously with this task?"
        1. invite team members to sign up for tasks by writing their names on the bottom 
        half of the task cards
* activity: **SMART goals**
    * purpose: translate ideas into priorities and action plans 
    * time: 20-60 minutes
    * description
        * SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. 
    * Steps
        1. offer an example of a SMART goal
            * "Our goal is to pair program at least 5 hours a day starting next Monday. 
            We’ll rotate pairs daily. We’ll create a chart with the pairing schedule, and
            review it at our next retrospective."
            * contrast a non-SMART goal: "we should pair more"

## activities to close the retrospective
* activity: **+/delta**
* activity: **appreciations**
* activity: **return on time invested (ROTI)**
